## Function Description

The function `getCompany` retrieves the monthly data for a specified `id`. It accepts one parameter:

- `id` (string): The company identifier.

The function returns a Promise that resolves to the `Monthly` object.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation of the `getCompany` function:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves the yearly data for a given kood.
 * @param id - The company identifier identifier.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the monthly cluster data.
 */
async getCompany(id: string): Promise<Monthly> {
    const pg = `
        SELECT *
            FROM "elujoulisuseindeks"."kuised"
            WHERE "kood" = "${id}"
        LIMIT 1;
    `
    const oracle = `
        SELECT *
            FROM elujoulisuseindeks.kuised
            WHERE kood = '${id}'
        FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY
    `
    const response = await dbQuery(pg, oracle);
    const res = Monthly.deserialize(response);
    checkMissingProperties(res, 3);
    return res;
}
```
### Postgres Query

The Postgres query to retrieve the monthly cluster data is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM "elujoulisuseindeks"."kuised"
    WHERE "kood" = id
LIMIT 1;
```
### Oracle Query

The Oracle query to retrieve the monthly cluster data is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM elujoulisuseindeks.kuised
    WHERE kood = :id
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY
```

## Summary
The getMonthly function constructs SQL queries for both Postgres and Oracle to retrieve the monthly cluster data based on the provided id.
It then executes the appropriate query and deserializes the response into a object,
applying the clamp method and checking for missing properties.
