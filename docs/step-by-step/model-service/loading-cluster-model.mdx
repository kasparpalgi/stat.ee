title: 'Loading a Cluster Model'
---

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to understand and use the `loadClusterModel`, which loads a TensorFlow Layers Model based on the specified cluster and model indicator.

```typescript
loadClusterModel(cluster: string, model: ModelIndicator): Promise<tf.LayersModel>
```

This method is responsible for loading a TensorFlow Layers Model based on the specified cluster and model indicator.

#### Parameters

- `cluster` (`string`): The name of the cluster for which the model needs to be loaded.
- `model` (`ModelIndicator`): An enum or type indicating the specific model to load.

#### Returns

- `Promise<tf.LayersModel>`: A promise that resolves to the loaded TensorFlow Layers Model.

#### Description

The `loadClusterModel` method constructs a URL using the provided `cluster` and `model` parameters to locate the correct TensorFlow model stored on a local server. It then uses TensorFlow.js's `tf.loadLayersModel` function to asynchronously load the model from the constructed URL and returns a promise that resolves to this model.

The URL is constructed as follows: `http://localhost:${port}/static/${model}_${cluster}/model.json`, where `${port}` should be defined elsewhere in your application to specify the port number of the local server hosting the models.
