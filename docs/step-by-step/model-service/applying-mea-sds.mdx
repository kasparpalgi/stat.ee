title: 'MEA and SDS Processing'

```typescript
resolveMonthly(id: string): Promise<number[]>
resolveYearly(id: string): Promise<number[]>
```

The `resolveMonthly` and `resolveYearly` functions are asynchronous methods within the `ModelService` class, designed to process company data by applying specific statistical adjustments based on mean (`mea`) and standard deviation (`sds`) values. They follow the same workflow but process different data: `resolveMonthly` handles monthly data using `monthlyRepository`, while `resolveYearly` handles yearly data using `yearlyRepository`. Here's a simplified breakdown of how they work:

## Parameters

- `id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the company whose data is to be processed.

## Process Flow

### 1. Retrieve Company Data

- Fetch the company's data using the `id`.
  - `resolveMonthly`: Uses `monthlyRepository.getCompany(id)`.
  - `resolveYearly`: Uses `yearlyRepository.getCompany(id)`.

### 2. Convert and Clamp Data

- Convert the retrieved data into a cluster format with `toCluster()`.
- Ensure all values are within acceptable bounds using `clamp()`.

### 3. Subtract `mea` Values

- Fetch the `mea` values specific to the company's cluster.
  - `resolveMonthly`: Uses `monthlyRepository.getMea(data.klaster)`.
  - `resolveYearly`: Uses `yearlyRepository.getMea(data.klaster)`.
- Subtract the mean from each data point with `substract(mea)`.

### 4. Divide by `sds` Values

- Retrieve the `sds` values for the company's cluster.
  - `resolveMonthly`: Uses `monthlyRepository.getSds(data.klaster)`.
  - `resolveYearly`: Uses `yearlyRepository.getSds(data.klaster)`.
- Divide each data point by its corresponding standard deviation with `divide(sds)`.

### 5. Return Processed Data

- Convert the processed data back into an array format using `asArray()` and return it.

## Returns

- Both functions return a promise that resolves to an array of numbers, representing the processed data for the specified company.

## Summary

The `resolveMonthly` and `resolveYearly` functions are crucial parts of the data preprocessing pipeline. They normalize and standardize company data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, ensuring the data is suitable for accurate predictions and further analysis.
