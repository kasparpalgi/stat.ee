## predictMonthlyGrowth

The `predictMonthlyGrowth` method is designed to predict the monthly growth indicator for a company based on its yearly data. This method is part of the model service that utilizes machine learning models to provide insights into potential growth patterns.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To predict the monthly growth indicator for a given company using yearly data.
- **Method Type**: Asynchronous
- **Parameters**:
  - `id` (`string`): The unique identifier of the company.
  - `klaster` (`string`): The cluster to which the company belongs, determining the specific model to be used for prediction.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to an object containing the predicted growth indicators: `low`, `medium`, and `high`.

## Usage

This method is used to fetch and predict the monthly growth indicators for a company. It involves several steps, including loading the appropriate pre-trained model, fetching the required data, processing the data into a suitable format for the model, making the prediction, and finally, formatting the prediction results for further use.

### Steps Involved

1. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Based on the provided cluster (`klaster`) and the growth indicator, the corresponding pre-trained model layer is loaded.
2. **Fetch Data**: The method fetches the required monthly data for the company identified by `id`.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - The fetched data is converted into a tensor.
   - The tensor is then reshaped to match the input shape expected by the model.
   - The reshaped tensor is transposed to ensure the dimensions align with the model's requirements.
4. **Make Prediction**: The prepared tensor is passed to the model to make the prediction.
5. **Process Prediction Results**: The prediction results are synchronized to a typed array for easy access.
6. **Dispose of Tensors**: To free up memory, all tensors used in the process are disposed of.

### Return Value

The method returns a `Promise` that, when resolved, provides an object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "low": "<predicted low growth value>",
  "medium": "<predicted medium growth value>",
  "high": "<predicted high growth value>"
}
