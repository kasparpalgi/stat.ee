## Function Description

The function `getMonthly` retrieves the monthly cluster data for a specified `klaster`. It accepts one parameter:

- `klaster` (string): The klaster identifier.

The function returns a Promise that resolves to the `MonthlyCluster` object.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation of the `getMonthly` function:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves the monthly cluster data for a given cluster.
 * @param klaster - The cluster identifier.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the monthly cluster data.
 */
async getMonthly(klaster: string): Promise<MonthlyCluster> {
    const pg = `
        SELECT *
        FROM "elujoulisuseindeks"."kuised"
        WHERE "klaster" = '${klaster}'
        LIMIT 1;
    `;
    const oracle = `
        SELECT *
        FROM elujoulisuseindeks.kuised
        WHERE klaster = '${klaster}'
        FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
    `;
    const response = await dbQuery(pg, oracle);
    
    const cluster = MonthlyCluster.deserialize(response).clamp();
    checkMissingProperties(cluster, 3);
    return cluster;
}
```
### Postgres Query

The Postgres query to retrieve the monthly cluster data is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "elujoulisuseindeks"."kuised"
WHERE "klaster" = '${klaster}'
LIMIT 1;
```

> The query selects all columns from the "elujoulisuseindeks"."kuised" table.
> It filters the results where "klaster" equals the provided klaster value.
> The query limits the results to the first row.

### Oracle Query

The Oracle query to retrieve the monthly cluster data is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM elujoulisuseindeks.kuised
WHERE klaster = '${klaster}'
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
```
The query selects all columns from the elujoulisuseindeks.kuised table.
It filters the results where klaster equals the provided klaster value.
The query fetches only the first row of the results.
Additional Logic
After retrieving the data and deserializing it into a MonthlyCluster object, the clamp method is applied to ensure the data is within expected bounds. Additionally, the checkMissingProperties function is called to verify that the cluster has the necessary properties, with a threshold of 3 properties to check.

## Summary
The getMonthly function constructs SQL queries for both Postgres and Oracle to retrieve the monthly cluster data based on the provided klaster. It then executes the appropriate query and deserializes the response into a MonthlyCluster object, applying the clamp method and checking for missing properties.
